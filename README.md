# orderedfilecopy
Copy files from one directory to another using GUI interface

This is a personal project. I found a problem with my mp3 player - it does not have a prebuild option to sort a list of songs. It plays the songs in the order first-come, first-surve basis. The project aims to sort files by name from a directory and copy them one by one to the mp3 player.
